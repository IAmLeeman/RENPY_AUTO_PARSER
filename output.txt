"{\"text\": \"That girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long?\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"

"{\"text\": \"Eeehhhhh, you say that like you were thinking about ignoring me!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori5c\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That's mean, [player]!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, if people stare at you for acting weird then I don't want them to think we're a couple or something.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Fine, fine.\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori1a\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But you did wait for me, after all.\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"

"{\"text\": \"Ehehe~\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori1q\"}"

"{\"text\": \"Did I...?\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"

"{\"text\": \"Uh-huh!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori4j\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I was talking about how I'm worried that you won't learn how to socialize or have any skills before college.\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"

"{\"text\": \"Why do I let myself get lectured by such a carefree girl?\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"More than that, I'm surprised I even let myself relent to her.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I guess seeing her worry so much about me makes me want to ease her mind at least a little bit - even if she does exaggerate everything inside of her head.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"

"{\"text\": \"Sayori...?\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"

"{\"text\": \"Honestly, you're even worse than me sometimes... I'm impressed!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You don't need to wait up for me if it's going to make you late to your own club.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, I thought you might need some encouragement, so I thought, you know...\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori1y\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Know what?\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, that you could come to my club!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori1a\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yeah??\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori4r\"}"

"{\"text\": \"Since she was the first one to show interest after the one who proposed the club, she inherited the title \\\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That said, my interest in literature is guaranteed to be even less.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"

"{\"text\": \"C'mon, please?\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori1g\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Why do you care so much, anyway?\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well...\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori5b\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I kind of told the club yesterday I would bring in a new member...\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And Natsuki made cupcakes and everything...\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ehehe...\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Don't make promises you can't keep!\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I can't tell if Sayori is really that much of an airhead, or if she's so cunning as to have planned all of this out.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I let out a long sigh.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Fine... I'll stop by for a cupcake, okay?\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yes! Let's go~!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori4r\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And thus, today marks the day I sold my soul for a cupcake.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I dejectedly follow Sayori across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori, full of energy, swings open the classroom door.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Everyone! The new member is here~!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I told you, don't call me a 'new member--'\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Eh? I glance around the room.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Welcome to the Literature Club. It's a pleasure meeting you.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori always says nice things about you.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Seriously? You brought a boy?\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Way to kill the atmosphere.\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah, [player]! What a nice surprise!\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Welcome to the club!\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"All words escape me in this situation.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"This club...\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"{i}...is full of incredibly cute girls!!{/i}\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"What are you looking at?\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"natsuki2c\"}"
"{\"text\": \"If you want to say something, say it.\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"S-Sorry...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki...\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Hmph.\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"natsuki5s\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The girl with the sour attitude, whose name is apparently Natsuki, is one I don't recognize.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Her small figure makes me think she's probably a first-year.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"She is also the one who made cupcakes, according to Sayori.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You can just ignore her when she gets moody~\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori says that quietly into my ear, then turns back toward the other girls.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Anyway! This is Natsuki, always full of energy.\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori1x\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And this is Yuri, the smartest in the club!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"D-Don't say things like that...\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri4b\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri, who appears comparably more mature and timid, seems to have a hard time keeping up with people like Sayori and Natsuki.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah... Well, it's nice to meet both of you.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And it sounds like you already know Monika, is that right?\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori1a\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That's right.\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It's great to see you again, [player].\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika smiles sweetly.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We do know each other - well, we rarely talked, but we were in the same class last year.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika was probably the most popular girl in class - smart, beautiful, athletic.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Basically, completely out of my league.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"So, having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little...\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Y-You too, Monika.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Come sit down, [player]! We made room for you at the table, so you can sit next to me or Monika.\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori4x\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'll get the cupcakes~\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Hey! I made them, I'll get them!\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sorry, I got a little too excited~\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori5a\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Then, how about I make some tea as well?\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The girls have a few desks arranged to form a table.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"As Sayori mentioned, it's been widened so that there is one space next to Monika and one space next to Sayori.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki and Yuri walk over to the corner of the room, where Natsuki grabs a wrapped tray and Yuri opens the closet.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Sayori.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki proudly marches back to the table, tray in hand.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Okaaay, are you ready?\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...Ta-daa!\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Uwooooah!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki lifts the foil off the tray to reveal a dozen white, fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The whiskers are drawn with icing, and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"So cuuuute~!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori4r\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I had no idea you were so good at baking, Natsuki!\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"monika2b\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ehehe. Well, you know.\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"natsuki2d\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Just hurry and take one!\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori grabs one first, then Monika. I follow.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It's delicious!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"sayori4q\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I turn the cupcake around in my fingers, looking for the best angle to take a bite.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki is quiet.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I can't help but notice her sneaking glances in my direction.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Is she waiting for me to take a bite?\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I finally bite down.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The icing is sweet and full of flavor - I wonder if she made it herself.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"This is really good.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Thank you, Natsuki.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"W-Why are you thanking me? It's not like I...!\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"natsuki5h\"}"
"{\"text\": \"{i}(Haven't I heard this somewhere before...?){/i}\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...Made them for you or anything.\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"natsuki5s\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Eh? I thought you technically did. Sayori said--\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, maybe!\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"natsuki12c\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But not for, y-you know, {i}you!{/i} Dummy...\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Alright, alright...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I give up on Natsuki's weird logic and dismiss the conversation.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri returns to the table, carrying a tea set.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"She carefully places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the teapot next to the cupcake tray.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You keep a whole tea set in this classroom?\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"After all, doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book?\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah... I-I guess...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ehehe, don't let yourself get intimidated, Yuri's just trying to impress you.\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Eh?! T-That's not...\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri3n\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Insulted, Yuri looks away.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I meant that, you know...\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri4b\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I believe you.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'm glad...\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri2u\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika raises an eyebrow, then smiles at me.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"So, what made you consider the Literature Club?\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"monika1\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Um...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I was afraid of this question.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Something tells me I shouldn't tell Monika that I was practically dragged here by Sayori.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, I haven't joined any clubs yet, and Sayori seemed really happy here, so...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That's okay! Don't be embarrassed!\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"monika1j\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We'll make sure you feel right at home, okay?\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"monika1b\"}"
"{\"text\": \"As president of the Literature Club, it's my duty to make the club fun and exciting for everyone!\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika, I'm surprised.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"How come you decided to start your own club?\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You could probably be a board member for any of the major clubs.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Weren't you a leader of the debate club last year?\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ahaha, well, you know...\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"monika5\"}"
"{\"text\": \"To be honest, I can't stand all of the politics around the major clubs.\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It feels like nothing but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events...\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'd much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special out of it.\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And if it encourages others to get into literature, then I'm fulfilling that dream!\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"monika1b\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika really is a great leader!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri also nods in agreement.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Then I'm surprised there aren't more people in the club yet.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It must be hard to start a new club.\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You could put it that way.\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"monika3b\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Not many people are very interested in putting out all the effort to start something brand new...\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention, like literature.\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile.\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important.\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'm confident that we can all really grow this club before we graduate!\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"monika2k\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Right, everyone?\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yeah!\", \"character\": \"Sayori\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We'll do our best.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You know it!\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Everyone enthusiastically agrees.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Such different girls, all interested in the same goal...\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika must have worked really hard just to find these three.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Maybe that's why they were all so delighted by the idea of a new member joining.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Though I still don't really know if I can keep up with their level of enthusiasm about literature...\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"So, [player], what kinds of things do you like to read?\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well... Ah...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...Manga...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki's head suddenly perks up.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"N-Not much of a reader, I guess...\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri3u\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...Well, that can change...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"What am I saying?\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Anyway, what about you, Yuri?\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, let's see...\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri1l\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"My favorites are usually novels that build deep and complex fantasy worlds.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri1a\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And telling a good story in such a foreign world is equally impressive.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri1f\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But you know, I like a lot of things.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri2m\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Stories with deep psychological elements usually immerse me as well.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Isn't it amazing how a writer can so deliberately take advantage of your own lack of imagination to completely throw you for a loop?\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri2a\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Anyway, I've been reading a lot of horror lately...\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah, I read a horror book once...\", \"character\": \"MC\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I desperately grasp something I can relate to at the minimal level.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"At this rate, Yuri might as well be having a conversation with a rock.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Really? I wouldn't have expected that, Yuri.\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"For someone as gentle as you...\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I guess you could say that.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri1a\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But if a story makes me think, or takes me to another world, then I really can't put it down.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Surreal horror is often very successful at changing the way you look at the world, if only for a brief moment.\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ugh, I hate horror...\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Oh? Why's that?\", \"character\": \"Yuri\", \"sprite\": \"yuri1f\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, I just...\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"natsuki5c\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki's eyes dart over to me for a split second.\", \"character\": \" \", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Never mind.\", \"character\": \"Natsuki\", \"sprite\": \"natsuki5q\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That's right, you usually like to write about cute things, don't you, Natsuki?\", \"character\": \"Monika\", \"sprite\": \"monika1a\"}"
