"{\"text\": \"I see an annoying girl running toward me from the distance, waving her arms in the air like she's totally oblivious to any attention she might draw to herself.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"However, I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let Sayori catch up to me.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We cross the street together and make our way to school.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"As we draw near, the streets become increasingly speckled with other students making their daily commute.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'm sure it's possible that I did, in one of our many conversations where I dismissively go along with whatever she's going on about.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori likes to worry a little too much about me, when I'm perfectly content just getting by on the average while spending my free time on games and anime.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Why do I let myself get lectured by such a carefree girl?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"More than that, I'm surprised I even let myself relent to her.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I guess seeing her worry so much about me makes me want to ease her mind at least a little bit - even if she does exaggerate everything inside of her head.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The school day is as ordinary as ever, and it's over before I know it.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"After I pack up my things, I stare blankly at the wall, looking for an ounce of motivation.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori wants me to check out some clubs.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I guess I have no choice but to start with the anime club...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori must have come into the classroom while I was spacing out.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I look around and realize that I'm the only one left in the classroom.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori is vice president of the Literature Club.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Not that I was ever aware that she had any interest in literature.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"In fact, I'm 99%% sure she only did it because she thought it would be fun to help start a new club.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Since she was the first one to show interest after the one who proposed the club, she inherited the title \\\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That said, my interest in literature is guaranteed to be even less.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I can't tell if Sayori is really that much of an airhead, or if she's so cunning as to have planned all of this out.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I let out a long sigh.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And thus, today marks the day I sold my soul for a cupcake.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I dejectedly follow Sayori across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori, full of energy, swings open the classroom door.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Eh? I glance around the room.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"All words escape me in this situation.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"This club...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"{i}...is full of incredibly cute girls!!{/i}\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The girl with the sour attitude, whose name is apparently Natsuki, is one I don't recognize.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Her small figure makes me think she's probably a first-year.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"She is also the one who made cupcakes, according to Sayori.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori says that quietly into my ear, then turns back toward the other girls.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri, who appears comparably more mature and timid, seems to have a hard time keeping up with people like Sayori and Natsuki.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika smiles sweetly.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We do know each other - well, we rarely talked, but we were in the same class last year.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika was probably the most popular girl in class - smart, beautiful, athletic.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Basically, completely out of my league.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"So, having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The girls have a few desks arranged to form a table.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"As Sayori mentioned, it's been widened so that there is one space next to Monika and one space next to Sayori.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki and Yuri walk over to the corner of the room, where Natsuki grabs a wrapped tray and Yuri opens the closet.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Sayori.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki proudly marches back to the table, tray in hand.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki lifts the foil off the tray to reveal a dozen white, fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The whiskers are drawn with icing, and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori grabs one first, then Monika. I follow.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I turn the cupcake around in my fingers, looking for the best angle to take a bite.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki is quiet.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I can't help but notice her sneaking glances in my direction.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Is she waiting for me to take a bite?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I finally bite down.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The icing is sweet and full of flavor - I wonder if she made it herself.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"{i}(Haven't I heard this somewhere before...?){/i}\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I give up on Natsuki's weird logic and dismiss the conversation.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri returns to the table, carrying a tea set.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"She carefully places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the teapot next to the cupcake tray.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Insulted, Yuri looks away.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika raises an eyebrow, then smiles at me.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I was afraid of this question.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Something tells me I shouldn't tell Monika that I was practically dragged here by Sayori.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri also nods in agreement.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Everyone enthusiastically agrees.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Such different girls, all interested in the same goal...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika must have worked really hard just to find these three.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Maybe that's why they were all so delighted by the idea of a new member joining.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Though I still don't really know if I can keep up with their level of enthusiasm about literature...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki's head suddenly perks up.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"What am I saying?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I desperately grasp something I can relate to at the minimal level.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"At this rate, Yuri might as well be having a conversation with a rock.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki's eyes dart over to me for a split second.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori sidles up behind Natsuki and puts her hands on her shoulders.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki averts her eyes.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We all sit in silence for a moment.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki and Yuri look quizzically at Monika.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika smiles warmly at me once again.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Now that we're back to the original topic of me joining the club, I bluntly come forth with what's been on my mind the entire time.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I lose my train of thought.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"All four girls stare back at me with dejected eyes.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I...I'm defenseless against these girls.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"How am I supposed to make a clear-headed decision when it's like this?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That is, if writing poems is the price I need to pay in order to spend every day with these beautiful girls...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"One by one, the girls' eyes light up.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori wraps her arms around me, jumping up and down.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika looks over at me once more.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Can I really impress the class star Monika with my mediocre writing skills?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I already feel the anxiety welling up inside me.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Meanwhile, the girls continue to chit-chat as Yuri and Natsuki clean up their food.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That's right - Sayori and I never walk home together anymore because she always stayed after school for clubs.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"With that, the two of us depart the clubroom and make our way home.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The whole way, my mind wanders back and forth between the four girls:\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori,\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki,\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri,\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"and, of course, Monika.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Will I really be happy spending every day after school in a literature club?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Perhaps I'll have the chance to grow closer to one of these girls...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Alright!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'll just need to make the most of my circumstances, and I'm sure good fortune will find me.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And I guess that starts with writing a poem tonight...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
