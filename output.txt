"{\"text\": \"I see an annoying girl running toward me from the distance, waving her arms in the air like she's totally oblivious to any attention she might draw to herself.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"However, I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let Sayori catch up to me.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I overslept again!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But I caught you this time!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Maybe, but only because I decided to stop and wait for you.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That's mean, [player]!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, if people stare at you for acting weird then I don't want them to think we're a couple or something.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But you did wait for me, after all.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I guess you don't have it in you to be mean even if you want to~\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Whatever you say, Sayori...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We cross the street together and make our way to school.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"As we draw near, the streets become increasingly speckled with other students making their daily commute.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"By the way, [player]...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Have you decided on a club to join yet?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"A club?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I told you already, I'm really not interested in joining any clubs.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I haven't been looking, either.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You told me you would join a club this year!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Did I...?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'm sure it's possible that I did, in one of our many conversations where I dismissively go along with whatever she's going on about.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori likes to worry a little too much about me, when I'm perfectly content just getting by on the average while spending my free time on games and anime.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I was talking about how I'm worried that you won't learn how to socialize or have any skills before college.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Your happiness is really important to me, you know!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And I know you're happy now, but I'd die at the thought of you becoming a NEET in a few years because you're not used to the real world!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Don't make me keep worrying about you...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Alright, alright...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'll look at a few clubs if it makes you happy.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"No promises, though.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yeah, I guess I'll promise you that.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Why do I let myself get lectured by such a carefree girl?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"More than that, I'm surprised I even let myself relent to her.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I guess seeing her worry so much about me makes me want to ease her mind at least a little bit - even if she does exaggerate everything inside of her head.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The school day is as ordinary as ever, and it's over before I know it.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"

"{\"text\": \"Hellooo?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori...?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori must have come into the classroom while I was spacing out.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I look around and realize that I'm the only one left in the classroom.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Honestly, you're even worse than me sometimes... I'm impressed!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You don't need to wait up for me if it's going to make you late to your own club.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Know what?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...There is no way I'm going to your club.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori is vice president of the Literature Club.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Not that I was ever aware that she had any interest in literature.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"In fact, I'm 99%% sure she only did it because she thought it would be fun to help start a new club.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Since she was the first one to show interest after the one who proposed the club, she inherited the title \\\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That said, my interest in literature is guaranteed to be even less.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yeah. I'm going to the anime club.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Why do you care so much, anyway?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I kind of told the club yesterday I would bring in a new member...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And Natsuki made cupcakes and everything...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ehehe...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Don't make promises you can't keep!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I can't tell if Sayori is really that much of an airhead, or if she's so cunning as to have planned all of this out.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I let out a long sigh.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Fine... I'll stop by for a cupcake, okay?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And thus, today marks the day I sold my soul for a cupcake.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I dejectedly follow Sayori across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori, full of energy, swings open the classroom door.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Everyone! The new member is here~!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I told you, don't call me a 'new member--'\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Eh? I glance around the room.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Welcome to the Literature Club. It's a pleasure meeting you.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori always says nice things about you.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Seriously? You brought a boy?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Way to kill the atmosphere.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah, [player]! What a nice surprise!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Welcome to the club!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"All words escape me in this situation.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"This club...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"{i}...is full of incredibly cute girls!!{/i}\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"If you want to say something, say it.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"S-Sorry...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The girl with the sour attitude, whose name is apparently Natsuki, is one I don't recognize.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Her small figure makes me think she's probably a first-year.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"She is also the one who made cupcakes, according to Sayori.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You can just ignore her when she gets moody~\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori says that quietly into my ear, then turns back toward the other girls.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And this is Yuri, the smartest in the club!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri, who appears comparably more mature and timid, seems to have a hard time keeping up with people like Sayori and Natsuki.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah... Well, it's nice to meet both of you.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That's right.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It's great to see you again, [player].\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika smiles sweetly.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We do know each other - well, we rarely talked, but we were in the same class last year.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika was probably the most popular girl in class - smart, beautiful, athletic.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Basically, completely out of my league.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"So, having her smile at me so genuinely feels a little...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Y-You too, Monika.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'll get the cupcakes~\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Hey! I made them, I'll get them!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Then, how about I make some tea as well?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The girls have a few desks arranged to form a table.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"As Sayori mentioned, it's been widened so that there is one space next to Monika and one space next to Sayori.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki and Yuri walk over to the corner of the room, where Natsuki grabs a wrapped tray and Yuri opens the closet.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Still feeling awkward, I take a seat next to Sayori.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki proudly marches back to the table, tray in hand.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Okaaay, are you ready?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...Ta-daa!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Uwooooah!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki lifts the foil off the tray to reveal a dozen white, fluffy cupcakes decorated to look like little cats.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The whiskers are drawn with icing, and little pieces of chocolate were used to make ears.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Just hurry and take one!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori grabs one first, then Monika. I follow.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori talks with her mouth full and has already managed to get icing on her face.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I turn the cupcake around in my fingers, looking for the best angle to take a bite.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki is quiet.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I can't help but notice her sneaking glances in my direction.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Is she waiting for me to take a bite?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I finally bite down.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The icing is sweet and full of flavor - I wonder if she made it herself.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"This is really good.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Thank you, Natsuki.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"{i}(Haven't I heard this somewhere before...?){/i}\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Eh? I thought you technically did. Sayori said--\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But not for, y-you know, {i}you!{/i} Dummy...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Alright, alright...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I give up on Natsuki's weird logic and dismiss the conversation.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri returns to the table, carrying a tea set.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"She carefully places a teacup in front of each of us before setting down the teapot next to the cupcake tray.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You keep a whole tea set in this classroom?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Don't worry, the teachers gave us permission.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"After all, doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy a good book?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah... I-I guess...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ehehe, don't let yourself get intimidated, Yuri's just trying to impress you.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Insulted, Yuri looks away.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I believe you.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, tea and reading might not be a pastime for me, but I at least enjoy tea.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika raises an eyebrow, then smiles at me.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Um...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I was afraid of this question.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Something tells me I shouldn't tell Monika that I was practically dragged here by Sayori.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well, I haven't joined any clubs yet, and Sayori seemed really happy here, so...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"As president of the Literature Club, it's my duty to make the club fun and exciting for everyone!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika, I'm surprised.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"How come you decided to start your own club?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You could probably be a board member for any of the major clubs.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Weren't you a leader of the debate club last year?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"To be honest, I can't stand all of the politics around the major clubs.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It feels like nothing but arguing about the budget and publicity and how to prepare for events...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'd much rather take something I personally enjoy and make something special out of it.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika really is a great leader!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri also nods in agreement.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Then I'm surprised there aren't more people in the club yet.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It must be hard to start a new club.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Not many people are very interested in putting out all the effort to start something brand new...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Especially when it's something that doesn't grab your attention, like literature.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Right, everyone?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yeah!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We'll do our best.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You know it!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Everyone enthusiastically agrees.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Such different girls, all interested in the same goal...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika must have worked really hard just to find these three.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Maybe that's why they were all so delighted by the idea of a new member joining.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Though I still don't really know if I can keep up with their level of enthusiasm about literature...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"So, [player], what kinds of things do you like to read?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Well... Ah...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Considering how little I've read these past few years, I don't really have a good way of answering that.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...Manga...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I mutter quietly to myself, half-joking.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki's head suddenly perks up.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It looks like she wants to say something, but she keeps quiet.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...Well, that can change...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"What am I saying?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I spoke without thinking after seeing Yuri's sad smile.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Anyway, what about you, Yuri?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri traces the rim of her teacup with her finger.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"The level of creativity and craftsmanship behind them is amazing to me.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yuri goes on, clearly passionate about her reading.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"She seemed so reserved and timid since the moment I walked in, but it's obvious by the way her eyes light up that she finds her comfort in the world of books, not people.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Stories with deep psychological elements usually immerse me as well.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Anyway, I've been reading a lot of horror lately...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah, I read a horror book once...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I desperately grasp something I can relate to at the minimal level.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"At this rate, Yuri might as well be having a conversation with a rock.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Really? I wouldn't have expected that, Yuri.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"For someone as gentle as you...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"But if a story makes me think, or takes me to another world, then I really can't put it down.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Surreal horror is often very successful at changing the way you look at the world, if only for a brief moment.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ugh, I hate horror...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki's eyes dart over to me for a split second.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"W-What?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"What gives you that idea?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"It looked like you were working on a poem called--\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Don't say it out loud!!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"And give that back!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ehehe, your cupcakes, your poems...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Everything you do is just as cute as you are~\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori sidles up behind Natsuki and puts her hands on her shoulders.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki, you write your own poems?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Why do you care?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I think that's impressive.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Why don't you share them sometime?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki averts her eyes.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You wouldn't...like them...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah...not a very confident writer yet?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I understand how Natsuki feels.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sharing that level of writing takes more than just confidence.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"You must be willing to open up to your readers, exposing your vulnerabilities and showing even the deepest reaches of your heart.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Do you have writing experience too, Yuri?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Maybe if you share some of your work, you can set an example and help Natsuki feel comfortable enough to share hers.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I guess it's the same for Yuri...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Aww... I wanted to read everyone's poems...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"We all sit in silence for a moment.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Okay!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I have an idea, everyone~\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Natsuki and Yuri look quizzically at Monika.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Then, next time we meet, we'll all share them with each other.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That way, everyone is even!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Yeaaah! Let's do it!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Isn't that right, [player]?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika smiles warmly at me once again.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Hold on...there's still one problem.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Now that we're back to the original topic of me joining the club, I bluntly come forth with what's been on my mind the entire time.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I never said I would join this club!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori may have convinced me to stop by, but I never made any decision.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I still have other clubs to look at, and...um...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I lose my train of thought.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"All four girls stare back at me with dejected eyes.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Y-You all...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I...I'm defenseless against these girls.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"How am I supposed to make a clear-headed decision when it's like this?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"That is, if writing poems is the price I need to pay in order to spend every day with these beautiful girls...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"...Right.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Okay, I've decided, then.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I'll join the Literature Club.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"One by one, the girls' eyes light up.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Sayori wraps her arms around me, jumping up and down.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"H-Hey--\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Welcome to the Literature Club!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ah...thanks, I guess.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I think with that, we can officially end today's meeting on a good note.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Everyone remember tonight's assignment:\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Write a poem to bring to the next meeting, so we can all share!\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Monika looks over at me once more.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Ehehe~\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Y-Yeah...\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"Can I really impress the class star Monika with my mediocre writing skills?\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
"{\"text\": \"I already feel the anxiety welling up inside me.\", \"character\": \"Narrator\", \"sprite\": \"\"}"
